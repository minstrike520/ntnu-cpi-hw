[KIM]
You are sunlight and I moon
Joined by the gods of fortune
Midnight and high noon sharing the sky
We have been blessed , you and I

[CHRIS]
You are here like a mystery
I'm from a world that's so different from all that you are
How in the light of one night did we come so far?

[KIM]
Outside day starts to dawn

[CHRIS]
Your moon still floats on high

[KIM]
The birds awake

[CHRIS]
The stars shine too

[KIM]
My hands still shake
