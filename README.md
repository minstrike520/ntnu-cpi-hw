## Policies
*copied from assignment instruction. The original one shall be prevailed.*

- Zero tolerance for late submission.
- Please pack all your submissions in one zip file. RAR is not allowed!!
- For convenience, your executable programs must be named following the rule hwXXYY, where the red part is the homework number and the blue part is the problem number. For example, hw0102 is the executable program for homework #1 problem 2.
- I only accept PDF or TEXT. MS Word is not allowed.
- Do not forget your Makefile. For convenience, each assignment needs
only one Makefile.
- Please provide a README file. The README file should have at
least the following information:
    - Your student ID and your name.
    - How to build your code.
    - How to execute your built programs.
    - Anything that you want to notify our TAs.
- DO NOT BE A COPYCAT!! You will get ZERO if you are
caught.
